  <h1>How Ramnek Met Salve</h1>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="2" >
    <pre>
    Ramnek and Salve, an odd pair indeed,
Never met before, yet as close as can be.
Ramnek, in a frenzy, grabbed his phone so fast,
Texted his girlfriend, his excitement unsurpassed.

"I can't wait to see you, my dear," he did say,
"So thrilled, I might just show up a day early, by the way!"

    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="3" >
    <pre>
  Salve sat in her room, phone in her hand,
Anxious and tense, she couldn't stand.
What if someone saw them when they meet?
Her nerves were shot, she couldn't take the heat.
But then she shrugged it, and shook her head,
Realizing her worries were all in her head.
She took a deep breath, and let out a sigh,
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="4"> 
    <pre>
    Ramnek, oh Ramnek, what a fix he was in,
To leave the house, oh, what a sin!
Raining, dark, and locked out tight,
He had to lie to his parents with all his might.
"I must go out," he said with a pout,
"but  it's locked out outside, and that's no doubt."
thought Ramnek in his head lout, and they played their part,
In this comical, fortunate start.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="5"> 
    <pre>
Ramnek, sly as a fox, left the house with glee,
Past the gate, oh, what a sight to see!
His parents' mood, he dared to defy,
For his love, oh my, oh my!
Eager and excited, his heart all aglow,
To meet his love, come rain or snow.
Sneaking away, his happiness uncurbed,
In love's adventure, he was fully absorbed.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="6"> 
    <pre>
    Ramnek walked the roads, empty and bare,
Dark, rainy, and cold, but he didn't care.
His love for Salve, it kept him strong,
The streets were barren, everything was close,
But Ramnek's heart, it was all aglow.
For he was eager and excited to meet his love,
And nothing could stop him, not even the rain above.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="7"> 
    <pre>
    As Ramnek marched on, a sight to behold,
The dogs looked at him, their expressions bold.
Puzzled they were, at his peculiar stroll,
In the dark and rain, his actions took their toll.
But Ramnek, undeterred, with a smile on his face,
Marched on happily, at his own pace.
</pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="8"> 
    <pre>
In this world where Covid reigns,
And staying indoors is the refrain,
Signs warn of jail, if we stray,
The streets are empty, the world is closed,
Everything looked deserted, empty and the dogs bold
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="9"> 
    <pre>
    Ramnek, the ninja, dodged the cops,
Through wires and dogs, with daring hops.
His love's sweet call, like a siren's song,
Pulled him along, righting every wrong.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="10"> 
    <pre>
    The police gave chase, oh what a race,
Ramnek sprinted, setting his pace.
They huffed and puffed, but he was too fleet,
A slippery rascal, nimble on his feet.
Through alleys and streets, he led them astray,
The police, bewildered, couldn't find their way.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="11"> 
    <pre>
Ramnek got all wet in the rain,
Stopped to shake off, like a playful pup's game.
Took a break under a shed so dry,
Then off he went, no time to be shy.
    </pre>

<section class="story_main" id="12"> 
    <pre>
Sunpreet, so pretty, with a worried frown,
Lay in her bed, feeling quite down.
She wondered and pondered, her thoughts a whirl,
What if Ramnek didn't come, to see his girl?

Covid had struck, everything shut tight,
No outings, no dinners, no movie night.
She missed his smile, his laugh, his touch,
Being apart from him hurt too much.

    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="13"> 
    <pre>
    Ramnek made it to Sunpreet's place,
Heaved a sigh, relief on his face.
Excited, oh so much, to be there,
Finally, with Salve, his dear.
    </pre>
    
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="14"> 
    <pre>
He texted Sunpreet, right from her gate,
Excitedly told her, couldn't wait.
"I'm here!" he said, all thrilled and bold,
Ready to see her, his heart consoled.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="15"> 
    <pre>
Sunpreet, in her room, got the text with a bounce,
Jumped from her bed, almost did a pounce.
Breathing fast, a mix of joy and fear,
Ramnek's arrival, oh, so near!

Happiness bubbled, anxiety too,
Meeting Ramnek, a dream come true.
Could it be real, she thought in bed,
Finally seeing him, cheeks turning red.
    </pre>
    
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="16"> 
    <pre>
    Ramenk saw Sunpreet, oh, what a sight,
She was the prettiest, in the day or night.
So cute, so pretty, like a shining light,
His heart raced fast, like a bird in flight.

He thought she could hear it, thump, thump, thump,
Like a drum beating, a joyful bump.
In all her beauty, she stood so near,
Ramenk's heart, full of love, no fear.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="17"> 
    <pre>
Salve whispered, "Sneak past the stairs,
Quick and quiet, no one sees."
Ramnek nodded, "Roger that, Captain,"

No one noticed, no one knew,
Ramenk was here, the plan flew.
Salve smiled, mischief in her eyes,
Together, their adventure would rise.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="18"> 
    <pre>
In Ramnek's arms, Salve at last,
They hugged so tight, the moment a blast.
Looking in each other's eyes, so deep,
Their love, in words, they did keep.

"I love you," they both did say,
In their hearts, forever to stay.
Hugs and love, in that sweet embrace,
A moment frozen, in time and space.
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="19"> 
    <pre>
Ramnek kissed Salve, she kissed him too,
Kissing and laughing, feeling brand new.
They couldn't stop, love in the air,
Kissing and loving, without a care.

Laughing and kissing, so full of joy,
Just like a kid with a brand-new toy.
In each other's arms, they found bliss,
Kissing and laughing, in a moment like this
    </pre>
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="20"> 
    <pre>
Time to go, Ramnek left with care,
Salve watched him go, from her window's stare.
He saw her beauty, a smile so wide,
Waving and smiling, eyes full of pride.

She waved and smiled, with a heart so true,
Ramnek returned it, a bond they knew.
No need for words, their love was clear,
In that moment, nothing to fear.
    </pre>
    
</section>
<section class="story_main" id="21"> 
    <pre>
Kids, that's the tale of Ramnek and Salve,
In love and war, together they brave.
Forever bound, in each other's heart,
Their love's a story, a beautiful art.

Made for each other, a perfect pair,
Their love's a flame, always to flare.
Through ups and downs, their love will grow,
In each other's arms, they'll always glow.
